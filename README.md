<h1 align="center">Bored Gamers</h1>

# Description

This was the final project of the course and I chose to build a board game app which allows the user to add their favourite board games and also add their own custom games too. I created a API in python which is linked to a data base which stores the users and the boardgames. 


# Deployment link

https://boredgamers.netlify.app/boardgames


# Getting Started/Code Installation

1. Clone the front end and back end
2. Open both folders in VSC
    - On the front end type `npm run dev` into the terminal
    - On the back end type `python manage.py runserver` into the terminal
3. Create a .env file and add `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
4. Follow the link in the front end termial


# Timeframe & Working Team (Solo/Pair/Group)

I started working on this solo project on 4th June and finish on the 12th June


# Technologies Used

### Front End

  - React
  - React Router
  - JavaScript
  - CSS

### Other Tools

  - GitHub
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Postman
  - Vite
  - Python
  - Django
  - Django REST Framework


# Brief

### MVP

  - The app utilizes Django templates for rendering templates to users.
  - PostgreSQL is used as the database management system.
  - The app uses Djangoâ€™s built-in session-based authentication.
  - Authorization is implemented in the app. Guest users (those not signed in) should not be able to create, update, or delete data in the application or access functionality allowing those actions.
  - The app has at least one data entity in addition to the User model. At least one entity must have a relationship with the User model.
  - The app has full CRUD functionality.
  - The app is deployed online so that the rest of the world can use it.
